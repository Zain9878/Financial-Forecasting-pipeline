# Financial-Forecasting-pipeline
I work on build a financial forecasting pipeline in Python using stock data 

In this project
Explore the Data (EDA)
  - Draw graphs to see trends and patterns
  - Check for any outliers or strange values
Make New Features
  - Add moving averages, returns, or volatility
  - Change text data into numbers if needed
  - Scale numbers if models need it
Choose and Train Model
  - For stock prices: use Linear Regression or ARIMA
  - For credit risk: use Logistic Regression or Decision Tree
  - For revenue: use regression models
  - Split data into train and test sets
  - Train the model and make predictions
Check Model Accuracy
  - For prediction models: use RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
  - For classification models: use accuracy, precision, recall
Show the Results
  - Plot graphs: actual vs predicted
  - Show forecast trends
Use Advanced Models
  - Simulate future prices using Geometric Brownian Motion
  - Calculate option prices with Black-Scholes or Binomial Trees
